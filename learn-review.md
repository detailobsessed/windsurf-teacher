auto_execution_mode: 1

1. Use the windsurf-teacher MCP tools to fetch recent concepts with `get_learning_gaps`
2. Pick 3-5 concepts that are due for review
3. For each concept, briefly explain it and ask me a question that tests understanding (not memory)
4. After I answer, confirm whether I got it right and add any nuance I missed
5. At the end, use `log_concept` to update the review_count for concepts I got right
